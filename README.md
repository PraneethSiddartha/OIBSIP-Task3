To predict car prices, start by collecting a dataset containing information about car features and their corresponding prices. Clean the data by addressing missing values and converting categorical variables. Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights, visualize relationships, and perform feature engineering for improved model performance. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then select a suitable regression algorithm, such as linear regression or decision trees. Train the model with the training data, evaluate its performance on the testing set, and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal results. Finally, use the trained model to predict car prices, and if necessary, deploy it for real-world applications.
